# Overview:
Event Gate: This project acts like an alternative to Ticketmaster, allowing users to search for local events, view them through a calendar, and saving these events into memory for viewing at later times.

# TODOs



# File Structure
- Users can create accounts with a personal username and password to be stored into local memory
- Users can search for events near them based on location
- Users can categorize the events they search for based on specific categories
- Users can view events in a calendar format, viewing events based off of date
- Users can save events to be viewed later
- Users can view the description of the events

# Style
- [chore]: Used to represent menial tasks that were simple fixes or style cleanup.
- [feat/Feature]: used to represent a large task that is a new feature to the program.

# Setup
In order to properly use the Ticketmaster API, you must sign up to Ticketmaster's open source developer site; then you will receive an API Key from the Discovery API. This should be substituted into the EventDataAccessObject's API_KEY constant. Only from here will you have access to real time events from Ticketmaster.
